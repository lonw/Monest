<h1>Common Questions & Answers</h1><p>
Below is a list of Frequently Asked Mortgage Question that we find many clients ask us when they come in to discuss their options.

<h3>1. What is a mortgage broker/agent?</h3><p>

A Mortgage Broker/Agent is a licensed professional working for a mortgage brokerage company. We work one-on-one with clients to get a mortgage for the purchase of a home. We can obtain a mortgage through traditional Banks and Credit Unions.<dr><dr>
A common question when people hear about Mortgage Brokers is “why should I use one?” The best explanation is that we are efficient, friendly, knowledgeable, and fast working. We choose the best mortgage rate and term that works for you, find a suitable lender, and then apply to that lender. If the mortgage is approved, the lender pays us a fee for bringing your business to them.

<h3>2. How do I decide between fixed and variable?</h3><p>

It depends on what your financial situation and lifestyle is. Many people prefer the security that comes with a fixed rate mortgage as they are always aware of how much of their payment is going to both principle and interest. In addition to this, the interest rate is guaranteed to stay the same. Those who choose the variable rate do so because posted rates for variable mortgages are lower than fixed rate mortgages. If rates are forecasted to stay low, you can realize greater cost savings with a variable rate mortgage. However, if the rates go up, you could end up paying a much higher interest rate than that of a fixed rate mortgage.

<h3>3. How long does the mortgage process take?</h3><p>

The length of time that it takes from initial application process until a deal closes and you receive a mortgage varies from deal to deal. The initial meeting with your mortgage broker is a fairly quick process, usually taking a maximum of an hour.<dr><dr>
After your first meeting, your mortgage broker will send the deal to a number of lenders for approval. Depending on the lender, an approval or decline can take from 24 hours to 4 business days.<dr><dr>
Once an approval is received, the client must gather the required documents to meet all of the conditions required by the lender. 

<h3>4. What is a pre-approval?</h3><p>

A pre-approval means that you have begun the mortgage application process, and have initially been approved by a lender for financing based on your income, your debts, your employment history.<dr><dr>
Pre-approvals are perfect for people who are not sure how much they can afford to pay for a house, how much down payment you require. The banks will “hold” your interest rate for up to 120 days. This means that if the interest rates go up during this time, you are still entitled to the lower interest rate during the holding period. If the rates go down, no worries, we can still get a mortgage at the lower interest rate.<dr><dr>
Pre-approvals give you the peace of mind that when you are searching for that perfect house.
