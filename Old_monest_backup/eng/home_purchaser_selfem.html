<h1>Mortgages for Self-Employed</h1><p>
Over 20% of Canadian income earners are self employed, business for self or are 100% commissioned. With this large of a segment of the population working for themselves you would think the mortgage banks in Canada would be a little more accommodating. Well they have! Finally. Most people in business write off expenses before declaring their income.
	That's the advantage of being in business for yourself. You pay income tax on a lesser amount but when you need to prove income for a mortgage approval, your tax returns make it look like your income is low and you can't afford the mortgage you deserve. Qualifying for a Low Documentation Mortgage is easier than you think. You can purchase a new property or re-finance your existing home up to 90% of its appraised value. The lender bases their mortgage approval on your good credit history instead of your net income.
At Monest Mortgage we understand your needs. Our lenders look at your credit history rather than business financials and personal tax notice of assessments. This is something most mortgage lenders won't do.

With Monest and our preferred lenders, you will find a product that is right for you.
<h1>The Low Documentation Mortgage</h1><p>
Purchase up to 95% Refinance up to 90%
Beacon Score LTV<br>

600 Up to 75%<br>
620 Up to 85%<br>
650 Up to 90%<br>
700 Up to 95% (purchases only)<br><br>

You will need:<br>
A clean credit history. (No bankruptcies or foreclosures. Any late payments on credit cards or loans may lower your chances of qualifying.)<br>
Proof that you have been self-employed for three (3) years. (Incorporation papers or GST number.)<br>
The property to be located in or near a major centre. (Please call for details.)<br>
Some restrictions apply. Please fill out our easy-to-use low-doc mortgage application or contact one of our representatives today to qualify!<br><br>
<h1>No Income Mortgage</h1>
With the No Income Mortgage, you can purchase a new property or re-finance your existing home up to 75% of its appraised value. Income and credit do not have tobe perfect. With 25% down or at least 25% equity CanEquity can obtain a mortgage for almost any income or credit situation.<br><br>

Please remember each application is unique and these are just some examples of the current products available to business-for-self persons. Here are a few things to remember when shopping for a mortgage:<br>
A self-employed person with a clean credit history in most cases will receive the lowest rates available.<br>
Although an established credit history does improve your interest rate, it is not a requirement for obtaining a mortgage.<br>
Please keep in mind that the property must be in or near a major center.<br>
