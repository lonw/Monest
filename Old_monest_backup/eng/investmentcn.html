<p>We understand what you may be going through. We are here to listen and help you. All of our clients receive our utmost attention and complete confidentiality. Consolidating your debts is nothing to be embarrassed about.</p>
        <h1>Debt Consolidation Loans</h1><p>
Debt consolidation is an ideal solution for people who can’t afford to make several payments each month. We help replace them with one easy-to-track low monthly payment. Generally, they also have lower interest rates than what your creditors charges. Therefore, each month you are saving more and paying less. This is especially beneficial if you have credit card debt in Canada.

<h1>Why do I want to consolidate my debts?</h1><p>
People like debt consolidation because it makes their life easier:
Easier cash budgeting, with one predictable monthly payment instead of several.
Lower payments, because a debt consolidation loan often has a lower interest rate than unsecured debts such as credit card accounts.
Lower payments, because a debt consolidation loan may have extended terms.

<h1>Do I qualify for a Debt Consolidation loan?</h1><p>
Apply to a bank, or other lender, with enough support to make them feel confident that you will repay the loan. To make your case, you will need to provide:
Your monthly budget, showing that you can afford the loan payments.
Evidence that you have enough income to make the payments. This could be your pay stubs, for example.
Extra security, either collateral (perhaps your house or car) or a co-signer.
<h1>Debt Consolidation Program Advantages</h1><p>
A debt consolidation program can reduce your monthly payments.
A debt consolidation program can give you a head start on credit repair.
A debt consolidation program can prevent you from making payments late.
With a debt consolidation program you can get the expert help you need to get your finances back on track.
A debt consolidation program will prevent creditors from harassing you or pursuing legal action.
