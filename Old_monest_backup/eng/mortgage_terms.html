<h1>Mortgage Terms</h1><p>
<h3>1. Closed mortgage:</h3>
<p>In some cases, a closed mortgage cannot be paid off, in whole or in part, before the end of its term. In other cases, the lender may allow for partial prepayment in the form of an increased mortgage payment or a lump sum prepayment. However, any prepayment made above stipulated allowances may incur penalty charges.

<h3>2. Open mortgage:</h3><p>
An open mortgage is a mortgage that permits repayment of the principal amount at any time, without penalty. An open mortgage repayment terms are more flexible than a closed mortgage, which do not usually allow for prepayment without penalty.

<h3>3. Fixed mortgage interest rate:</h3><p>
A locked-in rate that will not increase for the term of the mortgage.

<h3>4. Variable mortgage interest rate:</h3><p>
Fluctuates based on market conditions but the mortgage payment remains unchanged.

<h3>5. High-ratio mortgage:</h3><p>
A mortgage loan higher than 80% of the lending value of the property. This type of mortgage must be insured — by CMHC or a private company, for the benefit of the approved lender, against payment default.

<h3>6. Conventional mortgage:</h3><p>
A mortgage loan up to a maximum of 80% of the lending value of the property. Typically, the lending value is the lesser of the purchase price and market value of the property. Mortgage insurance is usually not required for this type of mortgage.

<h3>7. Down payment:</h3><p>
The portion of the home price that is not financed by the mortgage loan. The buyer must pay the down payment from his/her own funds or other eligible sources before securing a mortgage.

<h3>8. Principal:</h3><p>
The amount that you borrow for a loan (not including interest).

<h3>9. Property taxes:</h3><p>
Taxes charged by the municipality where the home is located, usually based on the value of the home. In some cases the lender will collect a monthly amount as part of the mortgage payment to cover your property taxes, which is then paid by the lender to the municipality on your behalf.

<h3>10. Title:</h3><p>
A freehold title is an interest in land that gives the holder full and exclusive ownership of the land and building for an indefinite period. A leasehold title is an interest in land that gives the holder the right to use and occupy the land and building for a defined period.

<h3>11. Title Insurance:</h3><p>
Insurance against loss or damage arising from a matter affecting the title to real property (e.g.: by a defect in the title or by the existence of a lien, encumbrance or servitude).

<h3>12. Credit history or Credit Report:</h3><p>
The main report a lender uses to determine your creditworthiness. It includes information about your ability to handle your debt obligations and your current outstanding obligations.

<h3>13. Conditional offer:</h3><p>
An Offer to Purchase that is subject to specified conditions, for example, the arrangement of a mortgage. There is usually a stipulated time limit within which the specified conditions must be met.

<h3>14. Closing day:</h3><p>
Date on which the sale of the property becomes final and the new owner takes title to the home.
